# I have imported the sales module
# When python sees this, it will look for a file called sales.py in the current directory
# If it doesnt find this file, it will look in a bunch of predefined directories that come with python installation


# import sales

# we have a built in module called path
import sys
print(sys.path)

# line 10 will print an array of strings
# the first element in this array represents the current folder
