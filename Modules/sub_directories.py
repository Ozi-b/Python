# If your package is becomming too large you may want to create sub-packages
# imagine if your ecommerce folder contains a ton of files, it can be hard to find and use certain files

# so in the ecommerce folder create a new folder under it called shopping and move the sales.py file into it
# remember that the shopping package is not yet a package file intill we add the __init__.py file into it
